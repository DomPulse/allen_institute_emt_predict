make sure all the things for the vectors are in the right indexes
fix some values (or nearly) based on what can be predicted well from ephys
see if there are any variables that monotonically decrease mse when approaching the correct value
if yes, optimize those first
related, see if there are any values where the average mse (of the resulting ephys vector) is minimized when a bunch of randomized cell property vector is set to the correct value
optimize on different subsets of ephys seperately and then combine candidates via that
